You are running SAS 9. Some SAS 8 files will be automatically converted
by the V9 engine; others are incompatible.  Please see
http://support.sas.com/rnd/migration/planning/platform/64bit.html

PROC MIGRATE will preserve current SAS file attributes and is
recommended for converting all your SAS libraries from any
SAS 8 release to SAS 9.  For details and examples, please see
