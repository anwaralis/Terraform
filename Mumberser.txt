Dear Sumitra,

As discussed, please find attached the document detailing the functional overview and summary of the SAS EUC application under Phase 1. This is the only EUC application currently hosted in the Chennai Data Center as part of Phase 1. The document provides insights into its functionality, user interaction methods, and core business use cases.

For Phase 2, which includes 90+ applications hosted in the Mumbai Data Center (many of which are vendor-managed), we are in the process of gathering the required details. We will share the corresponding documentation and inputs shortly.

Please let us know if you need any further information.

Best regards,
Anwar Shaikh

Certainly! Here's an updated version of **Point 3** with your input incorporated more clearly and professionally:

---

**3. SPOC for SAS Viya Environment & Access**
Since there appears to be confusion across stakeholders regarding which **environment (Dev or Prod)** to use, and which **user account** or credentials are applicable, could you please help by sharing the contact of a **SPOC who is responsible for managing SAS Viya infrastructure and access-related queries**?
Having a single point of contact will help streamline coordination and avoid further delays.

**Subject:** Required Inputs for SAS Viya Remote Connectivity Testing – Need Clarity on Environment & Ports

Dear \[Name],

As part of our current testing initiative for SAS Viya connectivity from the staging environment, I am trying to move forward with the firewall request setup. However, there are a few critical dependencies that require your confirmation before I can proceed.

Kindly help with the following:

1. **Environment Confirmation**
   Please confirm **which SAS Viya environment** (Dev or Prod) I should use for testing remote connectivity from the staging SAS server.

   * If Dev, can I proceed with the following hosts/IPs as discussed earlier?

     ```
     HKLVATAPQ734 (10.7.30.126)
     HKLVATAPQ735 (10.7.30.127)
     HKLVATAPQ736 (10.7.30.128)
     HKLVATAPQ737 (10.7.30.129)
     HKLVATAPQ738 (10.7.30.130)
     ```

2. **Port Details**
   My cloud team has requested **specific port numbers** (not generic ranges) to configure the firewall rules.
   Could you please confirm the **exact ports** used by SAS Viya on the selected environment for remote SAS/CONNECT access or API access (e.g., `cntspawn`, `sasspawner`, or HTTPS port)?

3. **SPOC for SAS Viya Environment & Access**
   Since there appears to be confusion across stakeholders regarding which **environment (Dev or Prod)** to use, and which **user account** or credentials are applicable, could you please help by sharing the contact of a **SPOC who is responsible for managing SAS Viya infrastructure and access-related queries**?
   Having a single point of contact will help streamline coordination and avoid further delays.

Your timely input on this is essential to move forward with testing. Please let me know at the earliest.

Best regards,
