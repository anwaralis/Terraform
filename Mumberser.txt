Dear All,

As discussed last week, waiting for your input on below open items for these Country applications as having the challenge with mandatory controls submission like SLA/OLA, Capacity Plan, DR plan etc.

EUC - @More, Yogita / Anwar share the list of EUC application with summary details to further check with Assurance team on the limitations/challenge for EUC.

Smart Mutual - @Ferreira, Sydney Leslie / @Khushboo, Divya (Mohini) to check with the respective production team and come up with these mandatory control evidences. If required seek help from @Joshi, Piyush.


Thanks and regards,
Sumitra
