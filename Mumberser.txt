Hi Yogita,

Please find the following :

1. Business Use Cases – 

1.	Regulatory Reporting – around 40 returns
2.	Business Reporting – 100+ MIS and reports
3.	Business Acceleration through data, analytics and campaigns – 300+ monthly activities
4.	Model development for Risk and Marketing by SCMAC CoE
5.	Digital Sales acceleration for India
6.	Sales productivity and revenue / ROTE dashboards

2. Business users – 20 users in India RA and Digital teams, 14 users in India SBIM, ~10 users in Group SBIM, another ~10 users across NFRR COE team, IN CTM, SCMAC : in total – ~54

3. Software Inventory – this software has only 1 Software as far as I know, which is Statistical Application Software (SAS). Requesting Jai to confirm. <JS: Agree>

4. Jobs / Scripts executed – I am attaching a sample here for your view. There are thousands of such codes available. Let me know what you need. This is a type of SQL query at the base level.

5. Interface – we have a SAS Viya application on our desktop. We connect to the server with a remote sign-on (viz. below). I don’t think this server interfaces with any other system. Requesting Jai to confirm. <JS: Agree>

SignOff; 
%Let Unix = 10.128.48.105 5030; 
Options Remote = Unix Comamid = tcp; 
SignOn UserId = _Prompt_;


6. EUC ID – based on what I know, this server does not have an EUC ID. I had raised this to Yousuf back in 2020 and 2021. I believe Prem Nazir (who used to look into this earlier) or Anitha Nazareth can confirm this. Again, requesting Jai to confirm.

Regards,
Rajarshi
