Dear Sumitra,

As discussed, please find attached the document detailing the functional overview and summary of the SAS EUC application under Phase 1. This is the only EUC application currently hosted in the Chennai Data Center as part of Phase 1. The document provides insights into its functionality, user interaction methods, and core business use cases.

For Phase 2, which includes 90+ applications hosted in the Mumbai Data Center (many of which are vendor-managed), we are in the process of gathering the required details. We will share the corresponding documentation and inputs shortly.

Please let us know if you need any further information.

Best regards,
Anwar Shaikh
