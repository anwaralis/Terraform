Dear all,

 

As mentioned in another thread a few days ago, I'm new to administering SAS on a Linux (Ubuntu) server, so apologies for the silly question.  It's a bit of a steep learning curve for me...

 

One of the reasons we've installed SAS is to allow user to connect remotely to our server via client-side SAS (I think running under Windows -- he bought his own license).  Is there a way I can test if SAS/Connect has been installed correctly on my side before I let the user test it?  (I can ask him now, but I guess I should do some basic checks or else many people will not be too pleased with me.)

 

I did come across this article (http://support.sas.com/kb/15/162.html), which lists the default ports used by SAS.  Clearly I would need to open up the firewall to these ports (i.e., 7551).  Anything else I need to be aware of?

 

I guess another reason why I'm asking is that *I* don't have a license for the client version of SAS.  If I had that, then I could test it myself by reading server-side error messages.  Or, is there a very reduced version of SAS client that I could download (i.e., for free) which I could use to test SAS/Connect on the server?

 

Thanks a lot for any advice!

 

Ray


Solution:
Go to the machine that has the spawner running. It should have SAS and be licensed for SAS/CONNECT.
Start SAS
Run the following code:
%let host=localhost 7551;
signon host user='<your_user_id>' pwd='<your_pwd_on_host>';
signoff;
 

This will start SAS and run it as a SAS/CONNECT client to the spawner on the same machine using the default CONNECT server port.

It that works provide the code to the user and replace 'localhost' with the fully-qualified host name of the spawner machine as the user would access it.



AWS .. Since it will be EC2 can you get the screenshot from the servers showing SentinelOne agent running ?
