Hi @Sundaram, Saravana Kumar,

As discussed with @Srinivasan, Kamalakannan, I am now able to log in to the SAS Viya's Dev environment. We have also gathered all the ports that users are using to connect to the SAS server. I have forwarded the port details to Preethi so that she can assist with the firewall rule configuration.

We are currently waiting for the Network team to enable/allow the ports so that we can proceed with the testing.

Best regards,
Yogita More
