HI @More, Yogita

Please create Chapter 1 of the SI – Initiative overview and present to your domain architect. Initiative overview needs to be created in ADO as a ADO work item of type “Solution Intent”.

Thanks,
Keshav



### Chapter 1 – Initiative Overview

**Initiative Name:** [e.g., SAS Infra Modernization for India DC Migration]

**Business Objective:**
To migrate legacy SAS infrastructure and user workflows from on-premises or AWS to Azure while ensuring continuity, compliance, and performance. The initiative supports the overall India Data Center migration strategy.

**Current Challenge:**
The existing SAS environments are fragmented across multiple platforms (AWS, On-prem), with limited documentation and minimal support from the original development teams.

**Proposed Solution:**
Modernize the infrastructure by:
- Validating staging environments
- Establishing secure connectivity to SAS Viya PROD hosted in HK
- Ensuring remote SAS job submission works as expected
- Documenting and automating migration procedures

**Expected Outcome:**
- Seamless migration of SAS workloads to Azure with minimal disruption
- Compliance with regulatory data localization policies
- Reduced operational risk through standardization

1.1. Scope of this User guide
1.2. Intended Audience of this User guide
1.3. Purpose of Solution Intent
1.4.  Where to Tag/Link Solution Intent work item 
1.5. Know your Solution Intent Stakeholders/Forums
1.6. Know your Solution Intent Sections and Approval Parties
2. Solution Intent High Level Work Flow
3. Solution Intent Detailed Work Flow
1.  Solution Intent - Introduction
1.1. Scope of this User guide
This user guide shall help ADO Delivery Team to create/modify/clone/update Solution Intent work item in the ADO.

This user guide shall help Domain Architect and Product Owner to provide their approvals in the Solution Intent workflow. 

1.2. Intended Audience of this User guide
ADO Delivery Team, Product Owner and Domain Architect.  

1.3. Purpose of Solution Intent
The Solution Intent (SI) is a technology-wide common architecture template to ensure consistent architecture/ design documentation across the organization.

An SI would be utilized across domain architecture, data, security & resiliency for approvals against established Bank controls. This avoids creation of disparate artefacts by ensuring all required information is available to all approvers for a holistic review. Additionally, this minimises new discoveries for project delivery team at later stages of the project.

1.4.  Where to Tag/Link Solution Intent work item 
Solution Intent work item to be tagged at User Story/Feature/EPIC level and not to tag under INITIATIVE level
Solution Intent is mandatory for at least at User Story level (or) at Feature level (or) at EPIC level
Cloned SI must be tagged at least at User Story level (or) at Feature level (or) at EPIC level
One SI can be tagged with multiple EPICs (or) Multiple SIs can be tagged with One EPIC
Don't Tag Solution Intent with Release work item
Don't Tag Solution Intent with Initiative
1.5. Know your Solution Intent Stakeholders/Forums
1	ADO Delivery team	Any member of the application can create/clone/modify  Solution Intent 
2	Production Owner	Initial screening/review done by Product owner before Domain Architect Review
3	Domain Architect	
Defines baseline architecture, target architecture and roadmaps (transition architecture) for responsible business areas
Develop and maintain domain owned Technical Standard
Develop and maintain domain owned Technology Patterns
Develop and maintain Domain Architecture Principles (if applicable)
Evaluates Architecture Impact for initiatives owned by business area
Chairs Architecture Review Forum and drives review of architecture artefacts against domain roadmaps
Identifies & logs design dispensations and agrees resolution approach as part of Solution reviews
Facilitates Architecture approval via Domain Tech Council
Responsible for Scoring reviewed solutions
Participates in design vs build assessment organized by Solution Architect and agrees dispensations and resolution approach
4	Country Architect	
Develops baseline architecture, target architecture and roadmaps for responsible country(s)
Ensures group and domain Technical Standards are applied to any country specific solution
Ensures country specific solutions apply established Technology Patterns and Architecture Principles
Evaluates Architecture Impact for country initiatives
Co-ordinates with Domain Architect to drive architecture approval via Architecture Review Forum/ Domain Tech Council for any initiatives with architecture impact


Country Architect will involve only if the solution is "In-Country" solution.

5	Domain Chief Architect
