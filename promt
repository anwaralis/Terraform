### Chapter 1 – Initiative Overview

**Initiative Name:** [e.g., SAS Infra Modernization for India DC Migration]

**Business Objective:**
To migrate legacy SAS infrastructure and user workflows from on-premises or AWS to Azure while ensuring continuity, compliance, and performance. The initiative supports the overall India Data Center migration strategy.

**Current Challenge:**
The existing SAS environments are fragmented across multiple platforms (AWS, On-prem), with limited documentation and minimal support from the original development teams.

**Proposed Solution:**
Modernize the infrastructure by:
- Validating staging environments
- Establishing secure connectivity to SAS Viya PROD hosted in HK
- Ensuring remote SAS job submission works as expected
- Documenting and automating migration procedures

**Expected Outcome:**
- Seamless migration of SAS workloads to Azure with minimal disruption
- Compliance with regulatory data localization policies
- Reduced operational risk through standardization
